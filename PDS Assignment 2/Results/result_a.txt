Missing Mileage, Engine, and Power values are replaced with the median due to its robustness against outliers and preservation of central tendency.
NA values of seat are replaced with mode, as seats are discrete in nature
For New price , its better to drop a column because it could lead to wrong analysis , if we input any values
